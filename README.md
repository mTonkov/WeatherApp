This weather application is intended to show the user some weather information about a specific location. When the application is started, location is retrieved, a pointer on the map is being set and a HTTP request to retrieve weather data is made. 
One tap on the pointer shows an info window with some brief information (current location name and temperature). When the info window is tapped, a new activity is shown with detailed information about the weather and a forecast for the next 4 days. 
As the weather for specific area/city is mostly the same, tapping within the area will not make another request. To select a new location, user should first de-select the current one by long-press on the pointer.
